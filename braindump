I'm trying to **make people able to express their voice freely and equally** in a community.

Example:

- Point out wrongdoing in the company ( corruption, harrasment,...)  by a janitor as much than by a CEO. And no risk to be fired
- Make decisions in your school ( funding, directions, rules,... ) by everyone be it a teacher or a student

What do I mean by community ?

It can be a explicit set of people:

- Company employees
- School students
- Citizens of a country
- People on a mailing-list (core devs, board of directors, ...)

Or an inexplicit set of people:

- friends of somebody (the more people share the box, the more it won't be true)
- people concerned by an issue
- anybody in the planet (planet-wide voting)

---------------------------------------------------------------

**Solution: An anonymous user-curated discussion forum**

How to only include a **certain set of people** ?

- email/domain whitelist
- third-party login

How to include them **only once** ?

- distribute access token and put them on a blacklist

---------------------------------------------------------------

**What should I provide ?**
